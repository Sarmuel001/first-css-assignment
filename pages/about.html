  <h1>This is Our About Page</h1>
  <p>I'm excited to share my experience with CapacityBay, where I'm doing a free web development internship. 
    This great citadel of learning provides great education, and the tutors are very supportive. Something special about the tutors is how they never get upset when asking questions 
    and explain things clearly. I'm grateful for their dedication and passion. Thank you, CapacityBay, for making this 
    internship a positive and valuable journey!</p>
